It is a public chat room for selected key public spaces in India

In India, since the key public spaces serve a large population it is difficult for these organisations to stick to a strict schedule.

For instance, a doctor might be serving in-patient while the doctor's outpatient's have to wait. The wait is not predictable.

With public chat room for a hospital, a few may be able to help others to know about the doctor's tentative schedule change and plan.

Similar condition, exists for many other public places. Seva club plans to offer the facility of a public chat room for these key public spaces.
